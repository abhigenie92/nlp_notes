Natural Language Processing Lecture Notes and Readings

## courses
This repository includes NLP notes from two courses:

1. COMS W4705: Natural Language Processing http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/cs4705-spring2018/
2. CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

### some differences:
* The latter course is solely focussed on Deep Learning methods, while the former also discusses traditional NLP methods.
* The latter course also includes more readings than the former one. The former one has hardly any.
* The former course has only some any publicly available lectures, moreover it has been updated after I took the course @columbia. I don't have access to new lectures, so I won't annotate them.

### similarity
Both classes include both slides and notes. If I find considerable overlap, I will annotate only either slides or notes.

### status
* COMS W4705: Need to organize and rewrite some notes, but mostly annotated already.
* CS224n: Just 1 lecture annotated right now, I think it is going to take atleast 1.5-2 months to complete.

## naming
* <2DigitLectureNo.>_(<2DigitSub.LectureNo.>_)<s/r/n>_<LectureTitle>
  * s/r/n - slides/readings/lecture-notes
* For ex: 01_s_wordvecs , 01_02_r_wordvecs.
