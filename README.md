Natural Language Processing Lecture Notes and Readings

## courses
This repository includes NLP notes from two courses:

1. COMS W4705: Natural Language Processing http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/cs4705-spring2018/
2. CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

### some differences:
* The latter course is solely focussed on Deep Learning methods, while the former also discusses traditional NLP methods.
* The latter course also includes more readings than the former one. The former one has hardly any.
* The former course has hardly any publicly available, moreover it has updated after took the course @columbia. I don't have 
access to new lectures, so I won't annotate them.

### similarity 
Both classes include both slides and notes. If I find considerable overlap, I will annotate only either slides or notes.

### status
* COMS W4705: Need to organize and rewrite some notes, but mostly annotated already.
* CS224n: Just 1 lecture annotated right now, I think it is going to take atleast 1.5-2 months to complete.
